# connect4

The code in this project is quite rough and includes a lot of experimentation and other hackery. Use it if you wish, but be prepared for problems.

## setup
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    source .venv/bin/activate

## tests
from root of project:

    ./test.sh
